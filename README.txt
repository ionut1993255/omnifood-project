Welcome to the "Omnifood" project !!!

On a general note, this is a presentation website for a fictional nutritional company.

I tried to make use of a UI friendly color schema and design. I chose to use HTML5, CSS3 
and Javascript ES6 for its ease of use in this case.

On the main page you will find a sticky navbar menu that, when clicked, will scroll down 
to the apropriate section of the website.

During the making of this website, I used visual cues from bootstrap cards, used color 
schema sites that provided me with the UI friendly colors and custom svgs for all the 
icons present in the website.

Here you can see my project in action: https://omnifood-ionut.netlify.app/

Hope you enjoy !!!
